MY LIFE IN CITIES - WORD PUZZLE

This project is my CS50x Final Project. It is an interactive drag & drop word puzzle where the player spells the names of cities I have lived in i.e. Barcelona, Cork, Perth, Essex, Hanoi, and Da Nang. Each city is a separate level with a flag hint, a color theme, a timer, random letter movement, and feedback when a correct word is completed and a celebration sound with confetti. 

HOW TO PLAY:
1.	Letters wiggle randomly on the screen.
2.	Drag the letters into the slots at the bottom to spell the correct city name.
3.	When all letters are placed and correct, the game plays a sound, shows confetti, increases the score, and moves to the next city.
4.	The timer and score continue across all levels.

*Click Reset to start again from the first city.
**If city is spelled incorrectly, player must reset to first city.

FEATURES:
Drag & drop interaction,
Random movement of letters using JavaScript,
Collision detection to place letters into slots,
Confetti celebration when a level is completed,
Audio feedback when placing letters and completing a word,
Dynamic background colors for each city,
Real country flags for hints,
Score and timer tracking,
Multiple levels stored in arrays,
Letters and slots generated dynamically based on word length.

WHY I BUILT IT -
I wanted my final project to be meaningful and personal, so I used cities from different periods of my life. I built the logic so the game dynamically creates letters, slots, themes, and hints for each city, which made the project more interesting to design and program.


WHAT I LEARNED:
DOM manipulation in JavaScript,
Event listeners and drag handling,
Dynamic element creation and removal,
Bounding box collision detection,
Timers, intervals, and animation movement,
External asset integration (confetti library and audio),
GitHub repository management and GitHub Pages deployment,
User experience design through sound and color feedback,
Technologies Used,
HTML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
GitHub Pages,
VS Code.
